## Usage

> yarn add // npm install

after finish installing depedency

> yarn start // npm start

build bundle for deploying

> yarn build // npm build
```

since lighthouse need HTTPS to make perfect score for PWA, I uploaded the website to firebase hosting, you can test it with a lighthohuse there.
